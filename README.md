# Logger üìù

Logger is an intuitive and robust tool tailored for logging messages across all your applications, whether it's a complex web application or a simple script. Ensure every important event is captured with Logger!

## Features üåü

- **Simple Integration:** Effortlessly embed Logger into your projects.
- **Versatile:** Suitable for both development and production environments.
- **Asynchronous Support:** Built to handle modern asynchronous JavaScript workflows.

## Installation üîß

Install Logger with a simple command:

```bash
npm install @rharkor/logger
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To start using Logger in your project, simply import and utilize the logging functions as shown:

```typescript
import logger from "@rharkor/logger"

logger.log("This is a log message") // For general logs
logger.subLog("This is a sub log message") // For sub logs
logger.info("This is an info message") // For informational messages
logger.warn("This is a warning message") // For warnings
logger.error("This is an error message") // For errors
logger.success("This is a success message") // For success messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message") // For debugging messages
```

### Debugging logs

Logger supports debugging logs, which are disabled by default. To enable debugging logs, set the `LOGGER_ENV` environment variable to `development` and it will automatically enable debugging logs. If the environment variable is not set, Logger will default to `production` and debugging logs will be disabled.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting üîç

Encountering the warning `Logger is not initialized yet. Please call and await logger.init()`? This means you're attempting to log a message before Logger is ready. Initialization typically completes in under a second.

**Remember: Logger initializes automatically upon import.**

### Resolution Steps

To fix initialization issues, make sure to await the `init()` method before logging:

```typescript
import logger from "@rharkor/logger"

async function main() {
  await logger.init()
  logger.info("This is an info message")
}

main()
```

### Explanation

To accommodate CommonJS compatibility, we asynchronously load dependencies like `chalk`. This setup requires that Logger isn't instantly ready upon import.
